## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset we are doing for the DATA 301 Project is about the popularity of games. In particular, we are going to use a dataset of the top 100 (one hundred) games on Google Play Store (Note that Play Store is often found in most non-Apple products). These games are ranked by how popular they are by the amount of ratings they get (the thing where you rate 1-5 stars). For example PUBG has 37276732 ratings, topping at rank 2. The dataset also explains other factors relating to the popularity of the games, including the number of 5 star ratings, the Average ratings per game (between 1-5 stars), the growth of the game (in both 30 and 60 days), install milestones, even the game category (i.e action or adventure games).
